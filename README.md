# Neural_Network_from_Scratch

Built a simple classification neural net with 3 layers (input, hidden, output) that takes handwritten character digits in a 28x28 pixel image format as input and outputs a digit class. 
The neural net is built by hand using numpy vectors and no pre-exisiting deep learning libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. 
Also programmed a simple GUI that allows the users to draw a digit using the mouse and uses the network to reecognize the digit. 
Pretrained weights are also uploaded to avoid having to retrain the network (though these are optional and the training can be undertaken on user end). 
The 'Project' pdf file contains more details about the project including the maths derivation, architecture and results. 
The final accuracy was quite poor at 74.7% as expected due to how simple the network was (no CNN) and simple hand crafted training procedure. 
Lastly, in addition to the repository contents, the dataset files must also be downloaded. 
These are described in the 'Project' pdf file with a kaggle link where the required files can be found.
